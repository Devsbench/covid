## What do we do?
Due to the Covid19 outbreak, many companies all over the world have slowed down their investments in IT. A lot of projects were suspended or even cut off instantly. This caused troubles for software development agencies that lost their clients and projects. Many developers engaged in those projects landed on the benches overnight. Software agencies suffer from this situation a lot because it’s almost impossible to find a new project quickly nowadays and having people on the bench generating costs. Our idea as an association of devs shops is to promote our available resources and share them with others and make this offer unique by offering special “covid” rates. We also propose a 1-day notice period to make you comfortable to scale down the team at any time you need. Discounted rates could cover at least developers salaries and not generate losses. Due to the situation as described above you have an unique opportunity to assign them in your projects. All of them are capable of working remotely.
