## What do we do?
Due to the Covid19 outbreak, many companies all over the world have slowed down their investments in IT. A lot of projects were suspended or even cut off instantly. This caused troubles for software development agencies that lost their clients and projects. Many developers engaged in those projects landed on the benches overnight. Software agencies suffer from this situation a lot because it’s almost impossible to find a new project quickly nowadays and having people on the bench generating costs. Our idea as an association of devs shops is to promote our available resources and share them with others and make this offer unique by offering special “covid” rates. We also propose a 1-day notice period to make you comfortable to scale down the team at any time you need. Discounted rates could cover at least developers salaries and not generate losses. Due to the situation as described above you have an unique opportunity to assign them in your projects. All of them are capable of working remotely.
 
## Why is this offer so unique?
This offer is so unique because you can save up to 60% of your costs and not compromise on developers quality. All of these software agencies are having a tough time and the main goal for them is to survive. You can help them by hiring their staff for your projects (short-term or long term). All of the proposed devs are available right now! Adding to that 1-day notice period makes this offer very special. 

## Why are our devs in the top 1% of talents?
This has roots in our business model. All software agencies provide services for others. Their core service is custom software development in models: (1) client team extension or (2) scoped project outsourcing. It means that they have clients only if their developers provide outstanding value. All of their assets are people. In simplification, they are selling people for hours. It means that they can not do business using weak and poor developers. Clients are approaching them because they know that software agencies have top tier consultants, knowing the most recent technologies and are experts in these. Only in this way software agencies can operate on the market and make profit. They recruit only the best people because they can make money only in this way. It’s that simple! Now you have access to the range of developers with special rates due to crises on the market. They can even consider selling you these people after the project, but now the only thing keeps them up at night is to survive and keep business they’ve been building for many tears. We are talking about companies between 10-150 people. These are specialized great boutique teams.

## What seniority of developers do we offer?
Mostly we offer Senior Engineers (8+ years of experience). A Senior Engineer will, amongst other qualities, require a shorter ramp-up phase, less overhead, code at a faster pace and produce fewer bugs resulting in a more cost-efficient option in the long-run.

## Why should you care as CTO / VP of Engineering?
If you are recruiting right now or looking for some staff augmentation this is an ideal timing for you because:
- All of developers are available right now (even from tomorrow). Software agencies want to minimize their lost so they are willing to give you people asap 
- 1-day notice period. You can terminate the agreement even in one day if you are not satisfied. This is a huge flexibility for you. You can easily scale up and scale down the team.
- You can have vetted, VERY GOOD software engineers. We are not Upwork where there are freelancers who disappear on the next day, and most seniors are not real seniors while asking for a $70/h rate. This is ridiculous. We provide you only devs who are on the payroll. All of them made us a lot of money working for clients’ projects for many years.
- Most of the software agencies that provide their developers have great reviews on Clutch.io - you can always check it before engagment.

## How does it work?
I would like to mention that we are not a staffing agency. All of the engineers are 100% under company payroll and not subcontracted/freelancers so you will not receive any recruiting/administrative fees of that sort. All of the developers are used to working remotely for clients. 

## Why this offer is better than any other? 
Two things are super unique in this offer: 
Quality of the people - vetted by many years working in software development agencies, working in many different projects. 
Save up to 50% of the price. Because of a hard time in the IT industry, you can have them for half price.
