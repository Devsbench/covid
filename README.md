# What do we do?
Due to the economic turndown, many companies worldwide have slowed down their investments in IT. A lot of projects were suspended or even cut off instantly. This caused trouble for software development agencies that lost their clients and projects. Many developers engaged in those projects landed on the benches overnight. Software agencies suffer greatly from this situation because it’s almost impossible to find a new project quickly nowadays, and having people on the bench generates costs (mostly the cost of salaries). They have two options: fire people on the bench or find them a project that covers at least their salary and some operational company costs. Our idea as an association of devs shops is to promote our available resources, share them with others, and make this offer unique by offering special “recession” rates. We also propose a 1-day notice period to make you comfortable scaling down the team whenever needed. Discounted rates could cover at least developers' salaries and not generate losses. Due to the abovementioned situation, you have a unique opportunity to assign them to your projects. All of them are capable of working remotely. It is an excellent opportunity for you to have ready to go team in a couple of days.
  
# Why is this offer so unique?
This offer is unique because you can save up to 50% of your costs without compromising developers' quality. These software agencies are having a tough time, and their main goal is to survive and keep people (as this is the only way to recover after tough times pass away). You can help them by hiring their staff for your projects (short-term or long-term). All of the proposed devs are available right now! Adding to that short notice period makes this offer very special. 

# How can you offer the top 1% of talent?  
This has roots in our business model. All software agencies provide services for others. Their core service is custom software development in two models: (1) client team extension or (2) scoped project development. It means they have clients only if their developers provide quality work fast. All of their assets are people. It means they know how to recruit and train the best people. Many engineers working for agencies are very experienced as they change clients and learn different technologies, domains, communication issues etc. Agencies can only do business with strong developers (no client wants juniors or devs not delivering on time and within a budget). Only in this way can software agencies operate on the market and make a profit. They must recruit and keep only the best engineers because they can only make money delivering great value to their clients. Clients do not pay for undelivered projects. It’s that simple! The other aspect of maintaining the quality of our work is that we represent only the companies associated with Polish IT Software Companies Association (SODA). Now you have access to a range of developers with special rates due to crises in the tech market. We are talking about companies between 30-300 people. These are specialized great boutique teams.

# What seniority of developers do we offer?
Mainly we offer Senior Engineers (8+ years of experience). A Senior Engineer will, amongst other qualities, require a shorter ramp-up phase, less overhead, code at a faster pace, and produce fewer bugs resulting in a more cost-efficient option in the long run.

# Why should you care as CTO / VP of Engineering?
If you are recruiting right now or looking for some staff augmentation, this is ideal timing for you because:
- All of the developers are available right now (even from tomorrow). Software agencies want to minimize their loss so they are willing to give you people at discounted rates
- 1-day notice period (to be confirmed in each case). You can terminate the agreement even in one day if you are unsatisfied. This is considerable flexibility for you. You can quickly scale up and scale down the team.
- You can have vetted, VERY GOOD software engineers. We are not Upwork, where there are freelancers who disappear the next day, and most seniors are not real seniors while asking for a $70/h rate. This is ridiculous. We provide you with only devs who are on the payroll (employed by agencies). They all made us money working on clients’ projects for many years.
- Most software agencies that provide their developers have great reviews on Clutch.io - you can always check it before engagement.

# How does it work?
I want to mention that we are not a recruitment agency. All the engineers are 100% under company payroll and not subcontracted/freelancers, so you will not receive any recruiting/administrative fees. All of the developers are used to working remotely for clients. You will pay only an hourly rate per developer. We have a simple Master Agreement and SOW that defines who and at what rate working for and you for how long. As easy as possible.

# Why is this offer better than any other? 
Two things are super unique in this offer: 
Quality of the people - vetted by many years working in software development agencies and on many projects. 
Save up to 50% of the price. Because of a hard time in the tech industry, you can have them for half price.
